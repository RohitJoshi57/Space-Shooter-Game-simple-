Will eventually revisit as I did find this experience fun and would like to make more completed by either adding my own sprites, adding a title screen, adding music and sound effects. Also noticed that python feels much more simple compared to other languages I learned in school such as java in my highschool CS class or C# in university. Learning on my own felt very similar to how I learned my other two coding languages as I felt as though learning code in a classroom environment always had felt more difficult even though at the end of the day I would learn much better through youtube videos. At the end of the day I enjoyed this experience and plan on creating more complex projects in the future using python as it seems like the most straight-forward coding language.
